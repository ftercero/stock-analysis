# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to find the total daily volume for 12 different stocks (Tickers) as a measurement of trade activity and the yearly return to find the most successful ticker.

## Results

### Best Investment
The most successful ticker was DQ and RUN in 2017 and 2018, respectively. However, DQ suffered a loss of 62.6% the following year whereas RUN had seen a small profit of 5.5% the previous year. Although RUN experienced the most success in the latter year, DQ's high return in 2017 is still a better return despite the 62.6% decrease. For example, if $100 were invested at the beginning of 2017, by then end of 2018 DQ would have a surplus of $136.80 whereas RUN would have a surplus of about $94.12.



### Code differences
There were two codes used to obtain the same results. The refactor code combined the "insert code here" to "insert code here". The difference between the two is in the "For loops" and how the refactored code used a tickerIndex to access the stock ticker index for tickers, ticker volumes, starting and ending prices.

### Output time
The refracted code was created to find a more efficient code to run stock analysis. As a result the refracted code was about 0.2 seconds faster than the initial code. If data increased 5 fold, the refracted code would be 1 second faster. To save 1 minute, data would need to be 30 times the size of the current data.

## Summary
The a potential advantage for refactoring code is time. However, it is possible that the time refactoring the code may outweigh the efficiency. 

From my perspective the original code was more simple to write and comprehend. The refactored code, used the tickerIndex frequently and was easy to get lost because the is all that my eyes focused on.
